The new tests are here (for wet2), and they use the same test.sh.
Until now you would have done:
./test.sh <...params...>
From now on, if you want to use the previous tests, you can do:
./test.sh wet1 <...params...>
And to use the new tests:
./test.sh wet2 <...params...>
For now the default is still wet1 because people are still using it, but in a few days I will change it.

For information on what <...params...> could be, just do:
./test.sh wet2 help
Also, all the information in the previous mail for the first exercise are still correct and usefull.

As always, if you find any problem you think exists in the tests, you can contact me at: nadir.izr@gmail.com.
All tests that we put here are checked in some way - we don't just throw stuff in.
So if you find a problem with a test, you should send me a mail about it since many people are using this, and
it could just as well be a problem in your code (or many others would have the same problem...).

I hope this helps you in your debugging efforts.
